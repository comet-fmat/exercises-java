/*
95.1: Plus
Let us start by implementing the method public Money plus(Money added),
that returns a new Money object that has a value equal to the sum of the object 
for which the method was called and the object given as parameter.

95.2: less
Create the method public boolean less(Money compared), 
that returns true if the object for which the method was called is less valuable than the object given as parameter.

95.3: Minus
And finally create the method public Money minus(Money decremented), 
that returns a new Money object that has a value equal to the object for which
the method was called minus the object given as parameter. 
If the value would be negative, the resulting Money object should have the value 0.
