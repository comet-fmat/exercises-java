    85.1: Weight of a person
    The reformatory class already has a method skeleton public int weight(Person person):
    The method gets a person object as a parameter.
    The method is supposed to return the weight of the parameter,
    so the method should call a suitable method of person, get the return value and then return it to the caller.
    
    85.2: Feeding a person
     Add to class Reformatory the method public void feed(Person person) 
    that increases the weight of its parameter by one.
    
    85.3: Number of times a weight has been measured
Add to class Reformatory the method public int totalWeightsMeasured() 
    that returns the total number of times a weight has been measured.
