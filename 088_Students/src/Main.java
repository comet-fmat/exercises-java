public class Main {
    /*
    88.1: student
    Implement class Student that holds the following information about a student:
    name (String)
    studentNumber (String)
    The class should have the following methods:

    A constructor that initializes the name and the student number with the given parameters.
    getName, that returns the student name
    getStudentNumber, that returns the student number
    toString, that returns a String representation of the form: Pekka Mikkola (013141590)
    
    88.2: List of students
    So the program asks for student information from the user until the user gives a student an empty name.
    After the student info has been enteres, all the students are printed.
    From each inputted name-studentnumber-pair, the program should create a Student object. 
    The program should store the students in an ArrayList which is defined as:
    ArrayList<Student> list = new ArrayList<Student>();
    
    88.3: Search
    Extend the program of the previous part so that after the student info has been entered and students printed, 
    the user can search the student list based on a given search term. 
    The extended program should work in the following manner:
